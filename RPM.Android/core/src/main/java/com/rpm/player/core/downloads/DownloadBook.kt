/**
 * The albums downloaded to this phone, and the files that hold them. The iPhone's `DownloadBook`
 * (RPMLibrary/DownloadBook.swift).
 *
 * Two facts are kept together under one lock:
 *
 * - **which albums were asked for**, with their tracks as they were when the album was asked for. The downloads
 *   page can then be drawn offline, and a removal knows which files belong to the album.
 * - **which tracks have a file**, and at what rate.
 *
 * Everything the screens show is worked out from those two facts when it is asked for. An album is on the phone
 * when every one of its tracks has a file, and downloading while some do not. Nothing is stored that could
 * disagree with them.
 *
 * **One lock for the facts and the files.** A download finishing and a removal can arrive in either order, from two
 * threads. [keep] asks "is this track still wanted?" and moves the file inside the same lock that [drop] deletes
 * under, so whichever runs second sees what the first did: a download for an album just removed is thrown away, and
 * a removal after a download deletes the file it finds.
 *
 * The files live in the app's own storage ([root]; the phone puts it under `noBackupFilesDir`), which no other app can
 * read, the system does not clear as it clears caches, and Android's backup leaves out: they are copies of what is in
 * the cloud, and an album would pass the 25 MB that Auto Backup holds for an app and stop its backup altogether. The book reads its manifest from the disk the first time it is asked anything, so the first
 * question should come from a background thread ([AlbumDownloads.begin] does this).
