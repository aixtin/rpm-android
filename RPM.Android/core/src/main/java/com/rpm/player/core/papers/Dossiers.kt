 * week is found next week. A failed request is not kept at all: offline is a temporary condition,
 * and saving it would leave the page blank after the network came back. An answer that the API
 * marked partial is not kept either, because the API finishes it in the background.
 *
 * **Two reads, for the two moments a page needs one.** [cached] answers while the page is built,
 * from memory or a small file, and never asks the network, so a record opened before shows its text
 * with the rest of the page. [read] answers from the same caches and goes to the network only where
 * they have no answer.
 *
 * **A request outlives whoever asked.** It runs in [scope], not in the page's coroutine. A page that
 * is left before the answer arrives does not cancel the request, and the answer is kept, so the
 * record is ready the next time it is opened. Two pages asking about one record make one request.
 *
 * Thread-safe: the maps are touched under [lock] only, and nothing waits while holding it.
