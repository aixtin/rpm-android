/**
 * What the player does without a network, as the iPhone's `Player` does it (RPMAudio: `startPlaying`, `playable`,
 * `theLineWentAway`, `theLineCameBack`). Made by the playback service only on a device that keeps downloads (the phone,
 * through [com.rpm.player.core.Services.line]); the TV streams everything and never makes one.
 *
 * - **Offline, only what is on the phone can play.** A start goes to the first track at or after the one asked for
 *   that has a copy here ([startAt], [settle]), and the queue steps over the rest as it moves on. The queue itself is
 *   kept whole, so the records that were stepped over are still there when the network comes back. With nothing on
 *   the phone from there on, nothing starts and the reason is said ([PlaybackFailure.Offline]).
 * - **The network going stops a streamed record at once** ([theLineWentAway]), with its queue and position kept and the
 *   reason on the screen. Left alone it would play the seconds it has read ahead and stop in the middle of a phrase,
 *   which is worse. A record read from the phone plays on, and so does a station: a station is not stepped over or
 *   stopped here, it stops by itself when its stream does and says so ([StationReconnect]).
 * - **The network coming back carries on from where it stopped** ([theLineCameBack]), if that was recent enough that
 *   somebody is still waiting for it.
 *
 * Everything here runs on the main thread, where the player's listeners are called.
 *
 * @param line the settled network reading: the one the offline bar shows, so the screen and the player agree.
 * @param said called whenever [failure] changes, so the service can publish it.
