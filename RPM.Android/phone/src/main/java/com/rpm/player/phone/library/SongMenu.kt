/**

 * the queue is already queued: adding it again would make a second copy where the person means *move this song up*,
 * which the queue page does with its own swipe. So the queue's rows have no play next in their menu at all.

/**
 * The long-press menu on a song, wherever a song is listed: the iPhone's `TrackMenu` and `TrackActions`. The items are
 * the iPhone's, in its order: play next, start radio, the favourite mark, and add to playlist.
 *
 * **Play next and start radio are on every row; the other two only on a song of this account's own shelf**
 * ([isMine]). A favourite mark is stored against an id, and a playlist names songs by id. A song on a shelf borrowed
 * from another account is not this account's, so the store would drop the write. The two items are left out there,
 * not dimmed: a dimmed item suggests "not now", but they never work from there.
 *
 * The app sets one menu at the root and hands it down the tree through [LocalSongMenu], as the iPhone hands down
 * `startRadio` through the environment. So every page that lists songs offers it without carrying five more
 * parameters, and the queue page is given the same menu with [UpNext.ItIsTheQueue].
 *
 * @param startRadio "Start radio" on the song: it plays now, and the queue keeps filling with songs like it. Null
 * where the app does not offer it.
