 * The player, raised over everything, the tabs and the mini player included: the iPhone's `NowPlayingSheet`

 * place), the title and artist with the heart beside them, the seek bar, the transport with play in the centre, and a
 * glass row of lyrics, the queue and a menu.
 *
 * The sheet moves with the finger on the grip and goes down when let go far enough, or when the grip is tapped. One
 * value, `offset`, moves it both ways, as the iPhone's `ScreenPull`. Its top corners are square against the top of the
 * screen and round as soon as it moves away, and stay round while it leaves.
 *
 * **The background is the album page's**, the blurred cover with the cover's own colour over it, as on iPhone where
 * the room cannot be drawn. The room behind the cover and the spectrum beside it are not drawn here yet.
 *
 * Fast-changing state is read low: the seek bar and the clocks read the position in their own composable, and the
 * lyrics recompose once a line.
 *
 * @param lyrics the words of what is playing, or [LyricSheet.EMPTY], which greys the lyrics key out.
 * @param lookingUpLyrics whether the lookup still runs: the one state where the key is neither lit nor greyed.
 * @param onNeedLyrics asks for the lyrics, when the sheet is shown and when the record changes. **Nothing is asked
 *   while the sheet is hidden**, so ordinary listening sends no record name to any service.
 * @param onMark marks the song playing or clears the mark. Null hides the heart: a station is not a song.
 * @param onFile opens the add-to-playlist sheet for the song playing; null leaves it out of the menu.
 * @param onAlbum opens the playing record's page; null where the library has no page for it.
 * @param onArtist opens the playing artist's page; null where the library has no page for them.
 * @param speakers the speaker picker's model; null hides the speaker key.
 * @param leaving set when the listening ended under the sheet: it goes down by itself.
 * @param onClosed called once the sheet is down, so the caller can remove it.
