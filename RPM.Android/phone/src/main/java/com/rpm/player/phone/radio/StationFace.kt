/**
 * A station's own logo, wherever a sleeve would go: the iPhone's `StationFace` (RPMSharedUI/StationFace.swift).
 *
 * **A logo published with nothing behind it gets a made ground**, a soft figure in the logo's own hues pushed away
 * from its tone, which fills the square while [inset] keeps the logo off the edges. The dressing is `:core`'s
 * [StationBadge], the same one the cast and the lock screen use, so a station's square looks the same everywhere.
 * The logo is fetched by `:core`'s image loader through [StationLogo]: rpm's own copy first, then each address the
 * directory lists.
 *
 * **Every caller gives what to draw instead** ([fallback]), because some logo addresses no longer work, and the right
 * stand-in differs between a 40 dp row and a large tile. It shows until the logo has loaded, and stays when none does.
 * The logo fades in over 0.25 s, as on iPhone; one already in memory is drawn at once.
 *
 * The request is keyed on the station and the logo stamp, so a recycled row never shows the previous station's mark,
 * and a logo changed in the admin is fetched again. It asks for the size drawn, not bigger.
 *
 * @param edge the side of the square, which is also the size the logo is kept at.
