/**
 * The stage: the landscape now-playing screen, shown over the whole app while the phone is turned and something is
 * loaded. The iPhone's `StageView` (RPMUI/StageView.swift), in all its figures: the record is 1.08 times the frame
 * height and its centre is on the right edge, so it runs off the top, the bottom and the right like a record on a
 * turntable; the column is 24 from the left and 20 up from the foot; the title is 34 points; the chrome hides after
 * six seconds.
 *
 * **It is meant to be viewed from further away than a phone usually is**, propped on an amp or a desk. That is why
 * the type and the keys are large, and why the chrome hides by itself and comes back on a tap.
 *
 * Behind the words is the artist's photograph, cut so the face stays clear of the record and the column, or one of
 * the visualisers ([StageLook]) in its place.
 *
 * @param speakers the speaker picker's model; null hides the speaker key, as on the iPhone when casting is not offered.
 * @param onPortrait the portrait key: back to the upright app without turning the phone.
