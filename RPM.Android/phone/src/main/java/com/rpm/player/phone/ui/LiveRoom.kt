/**
 * A card's room, moving: the iPhone's `RoomView(breathes: true)`. It is the room at full strength, breathing on its own
 * slow cycles rather than with the music, because a card is not the record being played. [seed] picks the pose it
 * starts from ([com.rpm.player.core.room.RoomPose]), as on iPhone, so the same list or card always opens on the same
 * picture. [zeroNanos] is when its clock started (`System.nanoTime`): leave it for a room that stands alone; give one
 * shared time to rooms that must draw the same frame, as the banner's cards do (`RoomView.Zero.shared`).
 *
 * It is a picture drawn in the page ([com.rpm.player.core.room.RoomPainter] says why), so it is clipped, rounded,
 * scrolled and faded with whatever holds it, and the glass over it frosts it.
 *
 * **It moves only while it can be seen.** The caller says when it should move ([running]: the iPhone's own condition
 * for each place). Besides that it stops while the app is not in front, while none of it is inside the window (scrolled
 * away, or on a banner card that is not in front), and while the player covers the screen. A stopped room keeps its
 * picture. It is drawn at a tenth of its pixels ([share]) and stretched smooth.
